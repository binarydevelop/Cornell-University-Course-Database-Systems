# RAID LEVEL 3 : BIT Interleaved Property
RAID 3 uses method of BYTE level striping and for redundancy we use one single parity disk.
In Raid 3 instead of bit level striping we use the method of byte level striping and for redundancy we use a separate parity disk.

We stripe byte level data across the data disks and store corresponding byte is kept in parity disk. 
Thus RAID 3 creates Redundancy with more usable storage capapcity than RAID 2 and RAID 3.

Here also since we are using byte level read/write operation all disks will be included in each read/write operation and thus only single operation can be performed at a time. 
The performance characteristics of RAID Levels 2 and 3 are very similar. RAID
Level 3 can also process only one I/O at a time, the minimum transfer unit is
D blocks, and a write requires a read-modify-write cycle.

This is suitable for long sequential read and writes.
