# RAID LEVEL 3 : BIT Interleaved Property

In Raid 3 instead of bit level striping we use the method of byte level striping and for redundancy we use a separate parity disk.

We stripe byte level data across the data disks and store corresponding byte is kept in parity disk. 
Thus RAID 3 creates Redundancy with more usable storage capapcity than RAID 2 and RAID 3.

The performance characteristics of RAID Levels 2 and 3 are very similar. RAID
Level 3 can also process only one I/O at a time, the minimum transfer unit is
D blocks, and a write requires a read-modify-write cycle.
