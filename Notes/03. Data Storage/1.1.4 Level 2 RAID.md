# RAID LEVEL 2 : Error Correcting codes

In RAID Level 2, the striping unit is a single bit. The redundancy scheme used
is Hamming code. In our example with four data disks, only three check disks
are needed. In general, the number of check disks grows logarithmically with
the number of data disks.

Striping at the bit level has the implication that in a disk array with D data
disks, the smallest unit of transfer for a read is a set of D blocks. Therefore,
Level 2 is good for workloads with many large requests, since for each request,
the aggregated bandwidth of all data disks is used. But RAID Level 2 is bad
for small requests of the size of an individual block for the same reason. (See
the example in Section 9.2.1.) A write of a block involves reading D blocks
into main memory, modifying D + C blocks, and writing D + C blocks to
disk, where C is the number of check disks. This sequence of steps is called a
read-modify-write cycle
