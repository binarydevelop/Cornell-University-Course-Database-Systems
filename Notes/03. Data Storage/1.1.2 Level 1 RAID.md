# Level l: Mirrored
RAID level uses the method of mirroring. Every data is written to two disks at the same time. Thus producing mirrored set of drives. Every disk will have shadow disk.

Mirroring is the method which provides redundacy and thus reliability. 

Improved read performance is achieved as we can read simultaneously from more than one disk. 
A from Disk 1, B from Disk 2, C from Disk 3 and so on.. 

But capacity reduces to 50% since every disk is duplicated. 
A RAID Level 1 system is the most expensive solution. Instead of having
one copy of the data, two identical copies of the data on two different disks are
maintained. This type of redundancy is often called mirroring.

Every write of a disk block involves a write on both disks. These writes may not be performed
simultaneously, since a global system failure (e.g., due to a power outage) could
occur while writing the blocks and then leave both copies in an inconsistent
state. Therefore, we always write a block on one disk first and then write the
other copy on the mirror disk. Since two copies of each block exist on different
disks, we can distribute reads between the two disks and allow parallel reads
of different disk blocks that conceptually reside on the same disk.
A read of a block can be scheduled to the disk that has the smaller expected access time.
RAID Level 1 does not stripe the data over different disks, so the transfer rate
for a single request is comparable to the transfer rate of a single disk.
