### Level 0 : Nonredundant 

![](../../assets/images/RAID%200.png)
Data striping helps in achieveing parallelism and therby improves performance. 
As data blocks can be read and write independently. 

it focuses mainly on I/O performance. There is no redundancy or fault tolerance. 
It does nothing to ensure data is safe. 
A RAID Level 0 system uses data striping to increase the maximum bandwidth
available. No redundant information is maintained. This being the solution
with the lowest cost, reliability is a problem, since the MTTF decreases linearly
with the number of disk drives in the array. RAID Level 0 has the best write
performance of all RAID levels, because absence of redundant information implies that no redundant information needs to be updated! Interestingly, RAID
Level 0 docs not have the best read perfonnance of all RAID levels, since systems with redundancy have a choice of scheduling disk accesses

Capacity in this has 100% usage since if we use 3 disks with 1 tb storage data can be stored on each of them.
