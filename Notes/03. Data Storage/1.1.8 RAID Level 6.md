## RAID Level P + Q Redundancy

The Raid levels discussed have tolerance to upto one disk failure. suppose if there is requirement to handle two disk failures at a time. 

It uses block level striping. The data to be written will be divided into blocks and striped across the disks but for each stripe it uses two parity blocks.

With two parity disks it is able to handle array time to disk failure. also these parity blocks are distibuted among the disks similar to level 5, this will avoid the bottleneck.

the two parity disks can be as p can be XOR and q can be ecc such as reet soloman, so if it has one disk failure data will be calculated as RAID 5 and if both fails both are used. 

The motivation for RAID Level 6 is the observation that recovery from failure
of a single disk is not sufficient in very large disk arrays. First, in large disk
arrays, a second disk lllight fail before replacement of an already failed disk
could take place. In addition, the probability of a disk failure during recovery
of a failed disk is not negligible.
A RAID Level 6 system uses Reed-Solomon codes to be able to recover from
up to two simultaneous disk failures. RAID Level 6 requires (conceptually)
two check disks, but it also uniformly distributes redundant information at the
block level as in RAID Level 5. Thus. the performance characteristics for small
and large read requests and for large write requests are analogous to RAID
Level 5. For small writes, the read-modify-write procedure involves six instead
of four disks as compared to RAID Level 5, since two blocks with redundant
information need to be updated.
For a RAID Level 6 system with storage capacity equal to four data disks, six
disks are required.
