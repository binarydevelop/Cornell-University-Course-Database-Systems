## Choice of RAID Levels
If data loss is not an issue, RAID Level 0 improves overall system performance
at the lowest cost.

 RAID Level 0+1 is superior to RAID Level 1. The main
application areas for RAID Level 0+1 systems are small storage subsystems
where the cost of mirroring is moderate.
 Sometimes, RAID Level 0+1 is used
for applications that have a high percentage of writes in their workload, since
RAID Level 0+1 provides the best write performance.

 RAID Levels 2 and
4 are always inferior to RAID Levels 3 and 5, respectively. RAID Level 3 is
appropriate for workloads consisting mainly of large transfer requests of several
contiguous blocks. The performance of a RAID Level 3 system is bad for
workloads with many small requests of a single disk block. RAID Level 5 is a
good general-purpose solution. It provides high performance for large as well
as small requests.

 RAID Level 6 is appropriate if a higher level of reliability is
required.
