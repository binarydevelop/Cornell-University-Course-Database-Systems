## RAID level 5

RAID 5 is similar to RAID 4. It uses block level striping with the parity scheme. Major limitation in RAID 4 was using a single dedicated parity disk and hence every write operation in that situation will require a write operation on the parity disk which creates bottleneck. 

In RAID this is overcome using distributed parity disk. Means distributing parities on all the disks.

In this data can be written parallely and each time the parity disk is moved to another disk. 

Multiple read requests can be handled parallely. ex if there is request to read block a from disk 1 and block e from disk 2 they both can be read parallely. 

similarly in RAID 5 write operations can be carried out simultaneously. 


RAID Level 5 improves on Level 4 by distributing the parity blocks uniformly
over all disks, instead of storing them on a single check disk. This distribution
has two advantages. First, several write requests could be processed in parallel,
since the bottleneck of a unique check disk has been eliminated. Second, read
requests have a higher level of parallelism. Since the data is distributed over
all disks, read requests involve all disks, whereas in systems with a dedicated
check disk the check disk never participates in reads.

A RAID Level 5 system has the best performance of all RAID levels with
redundancy for small and large read ancllarge write requests. Small writes still
require a read-modify-write cycle and are thus less efficient than in RAID Level
1.
