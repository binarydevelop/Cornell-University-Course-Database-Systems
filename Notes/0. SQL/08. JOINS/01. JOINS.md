# JOINS

## Inner Join

Inner Join is basically joining two table where records in both table match.
Suppose we have two tables student and courses .
Students Table: 
```SQL

+----+-----------+----------+-----------------+------------+------------------------+----------------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------+------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------------+
| id | firstname | lastname | email           | middlename | alternate_phone_number | phone_number   | enrollment_date     | years_of_exp | student_company | batch_date | source_of_joining | location  | course_selected |
+----+-----------+----------+-----------------+------------+------------------------+----------------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------+------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------------+
|  4 | Sakshi    | Roy      | some4@gmail.com | Agarwal    | NULL                   | +9175446865463 | 2023-01-07 03:42:59 |            1 | NULL            | NULL       | Instagram         | Banglore  |               1 |
|  5 | Rahul     | sharma   | some2@gmail.com | Oberoi     | NULL                   | +9175446865463 | 2023-01-07 03:42:59 |            1 | NULL            | NULL       | Facebook          | Chennai   |               1 |
|  6 | Prateek   | Sinha    | some3@gmail.com | bansal     | NULL                   | +917546756963  | 2023-01-07 03:42:59 |            1 | NULL            | NULL       | Snapchat          | Hyderabad |               2 |
+----+-----------+----------+-----------------+------------+------------------------+----------------+---------------------+--------------+-----------------+------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------------+
```

Courses Table : 
```SQL
+----+------------+---------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+
| id | name       | fee     | duration | created_at          | updated_at          |
+----+------------+---------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+
|  1 | Devops     |   25000 |        6 | 2022-12-31 05:14:11 | 2022-12-31 05:14:54 |
|  2 | Javascript |   30000 |        9 | 2022-12-31 05:14:11 | 2022-12-31 05:14:54 |
|  3 | DS & Algo  | 1000000 |       12 | 2022-12-31 05:14:11 | 2022-12-31 05:14:54 |
+----+------------+---------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+
```

We can see course_selected for all students are just 1 and 2 and no one has opted for 3. so when we will do inner join it will only give records which have both relations. Non matching records are discarded. 


## LEFT OUTER JOIN

All matching records from left and right table are considered 
                         +
All the non matching records in the left table which does not have match in the right table will be padded as null... 


Returns
    |
    \/
ALL RECORDS MATCHING 
  + 
ALL Records which are present in left table but does not have relation with any in right table . 

```SQL
mysql> SELECt firstname, lastname, courses_latest.name FROM students_latest LEFT JOIN courses_latest ON students_latest.course_selected = courses_latest.id;
+----------------------+----------+--------+
| firstname            | lastname | name   |
+----------------------+----------+--------+
| Sakshi               | Roy      | Devops |
| Rahul                | sharma   | Devops |
| Tudfsdfsfssdfsdfshar | Rsdfsfoy | NULL   |
+----------------------+----------+--------+
```


## Right Outer Join 

All matching records from left and right table are considered 
                         +
All the non matching records in the right table which does not have match in the left table will be padded as null... 

Suppose we have some course(Right table) which is not taken by anyone will also be considered. 

```SQL
mysql> SELECt firstname, lastname, courses_latest.name FROM students_latest RIGHT JOIN courses_latest ON students_latest.course_selected = courses_latest.id;
+-----------+----------+-----------+
| firstname | lastname | name      |
+-----------+----------+-----------+
| Sakshi    | Roy      | Devops    |
| Rahul     | sharma   | Devops    |
| NULL      | NULL     | DS & Algo |
+-----------+----------+-----------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)

```
## FULL OUTER JOIN

All matching records 
  +
all non matching records from left 
   +
all non matching recors from right

MYSQL doesn't provide FULL JOINS but a union would do the trick. 

```SQL
mysql> SELECt firstname, lastname, courses_latest.name FROM students_latest RIGHT JOIN courses_latest ON students_latest.course_selected = courses_latest.id
 UNION
SELECt firstname, lastname, courses_latest.name FROM students_latest LEFT JOIN courses_latest ON students_latest.course_selected = courses_latest.id;
+----------------------+----------+-----------+
| firstname            | lastname | name      |
+----------------------+----------+-----------+
| Sakshi               | Roy      | Devops    |
| Rahul                | sharma   | Devops    |
| NULL                 | NULL     | DS & Algo |
| Tudfsdfsfssdfsdfshar | Rsdfsfoy | NULL      |
+----------------------+----------+-----------+
```
UNION is basically like combining two results into a single one and remove duplicates.


## CROSS JOIN

It gives the product of all the rows in both tables. 
suppose left table has 8 and right has 4 then result count would be 32; 

```SQL
SELECT * FROM students, courses;
OR
SELECT FROM students CROSS JOIN courses;
```
It is basically used when we dont have anything to join two tables we use a cross join


## NATURAL JOIN 

In natural join sql decides on which column join would be done. by seeing in the left and right table for same column name. 

The result looks similar to an inner join where all the matching records are returned. 

```SQL
mysql> SELECT name, marks FROM students NATURAL JOIN marks;
+--------+-------+
| name   | marks |
+--------+-------+
| anurag |    95 |
| harsh  |    85 |
| sumit  |    80 |
| kae    |    65 |
+--------+-------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

But without providing a join condition how did sql manage to return the result ? 

We can see in both tables that we have common column id 
```SQL
mysql> SELECT * FROM marks;
+------+-------+
| id   | marks |
+------+-------+
|    1 |    95 |
|    2 |    85 |
|    3 |    80 |
|    4 |    65 |
+------+-------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

mysql> SELECT * FROM students;
+------+--------+--------+
| id   | name   | branch |
+------+--------+--------+
|    1 | anurag | cse    |
|    2 | harsh  | ece    |
|    3 | sumit  | ece    |
|    4 | kae    | cse    |
+------+--------+--------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)

```

And if no similar column names are found it basically does a cartesian product or a cross join. 


## SELF JOIN

Self join is when we try to do a join in a single table .

Suppose we have a table family. 
```SQL
+-----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field     | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| member_id | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| name      | varchar(50) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| age       | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| parent_id | int(11)     | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
+-----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
```
A row in this table will have a parent_id. so we can self join to know who is the parent of whom. 

```SQL

SELECT child.age, child.name , parent.age, parent.name 
FROM family as child
JOIN family as parent
ON child.parent_id = parent.member_id;
```

We can have all sort of joins here right, left
