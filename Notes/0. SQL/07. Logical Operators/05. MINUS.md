# MINUS

The Minus Operator in SQL is used with two SELECT statements. The MINUS operator is used to subtract the result set obtained by first SELECT query from the result set obtained by second SELECT query. In simple words, we can say that MINUS operator will return only those rows which are unique in only first SELECT query and not those rows which are common to both first and second SELECT queries.

Queries:
```SQL
SELECT NAME, AGE , GRADE
FROM Table1
MINUS 
SELECT NAME, AGE, GRADE 
FROM Table2
```
Output:
The above query will return only those rows which are unique in ‘Table1’. We can clearly see that values in the fields NAME, AGE and GRADE for the last row in both tables are same. Therefore, the output will be the first three rows from Table1. The obtained output is shown below:
