# CASE  

case is basically like a condition Example: 
```SQL
SELECT id, name, duration,
 CASE WHEN fee > 10000 THEN 'Expensive'  
    ELSE 'diploma' 
 END
as price_type 
FROM courses;
+----+------------+----------+------------+
| id | name       | duration | price_type |
+----+------------+----------+------------+
|  1 | Devops     |        6 | Expensive  |
|  2 | Javascript |        9 | Expensive  |
|  3 | DS & Algo  |       12 | Expensive  |
+----+------------+----------+------------+
