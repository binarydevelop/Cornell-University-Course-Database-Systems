# DISTINCT 
- Distinct is used in conjuction with SELECT commands, when we are selecting data we may have 
  same values but with distinct we get unique values. 
```SQL
  mysql> SELECT DISTINCT(author_lname) FROM books;
+--------------+
| author_lname |
+--------------+
| Rowling      |
| Rois         |
| Rowng        |
| Rowntug      |
| some randome |
+--------------+
```

- Suppose we have two rows with similar last name but different firstname then what we can do to select those is
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT author_fname, author_lname FROM books;
```

It will give unique combinations for firstname and lastname.
