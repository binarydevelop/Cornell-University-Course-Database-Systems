# LIMIT 

It limits the number of results that are returned from a select query. 
It is often used in conjunction with select and order by queries. 

```SQL
mysql> SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname FROM books ORDER BY 2 LIMIT 2;
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| title        | author_fname | author_lname |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
| Hayusr       | amangig      | Rowntug      |
| Harry Potter | J.K. Rowling | Rowling      |
+--------------+--------------+--------------+
```
```SQL
mysql> SELECT title, author_fname, author_lname FROM books ORDER BY 2 LIMIT 0,2;
```
Above is also valid what it does it actually sets a range for the limit from the 1st row here[0] select 2 records.
