# GROUP BY

Group by summarizes or aggregates identical data into single rows. 
```SQL
SELECT customerID, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY customerId; 
```

Group By can also be used to have multiple levels: 
```SQL
SELECT location, source_of_joing, Count(*) FROM students GROUP BY location, source_of_joinig;
```
It means put all those with the same values for both X and Y in the one group

Columns which are selected need to be in GROUP BY Clause as well .
