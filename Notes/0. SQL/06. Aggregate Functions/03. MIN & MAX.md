# MIN and MAX
```SQL
SELECT MIN(released_year) FROM books;
```

If we also need to select other columns as well while selecting MIN and max we need to write this query differently. 

```SQL
SELECT name FROM students WHERE years_of_exp = (SELECT MIN(years_of_Exp));
-- Above is called Subquerying. 
```
