# Subqueries

Subquery is a simple query placed inside another query.

It is a good idea to break a problem statement into several different queries and then merge it once we get correct compound result from those individual queries. 
```SQL
SELECT * FROM
employees WHERE employees.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
 `(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);` This is called subquery or inner query. 
Subqueries are written such as they can be processed independently and hence sql first runs this subquery. and then after that it is used to process the outer query or the main query. 

This can also be written as 

     ```SQL
     SELECT *
     FROM employees e 
     JOIN (SELECT AVG(salary) sal FROM employees) avg_sal
     ON e.salary > avg_sal.sal;
     ```

## Different Types of Subquery: 
1. Scalar subquery
2. Multiple row subquery
3. correlated subquery


1. Scalar Subquery will always return one row and one coulmn. 
    - This is an example of scalar subquery. 
     `(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);`

```SQL
SELECT * FROM books WHERE pages =(SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books); 
```
It's slow as it is running two queries. 

2. Multiple row subquery 

If a subquery returns multiple rows then it is called a multiple row subquery. 
These are of two types : 
  - Subquery which returns Multiple column & Multiple row
  - Subquery which returns only 1 column and multiple rows. 

3. Correlated Subquery

It is a subquery whihc is related to the outer subquery. Basically it depends on the values returned by the outer subquery. 

```SQL
SELECT * FROM employee e1
WHERE salary > (SELECT avg(salary) FROM employee e2 
               WHERE e2.dept_name = e1.dept_name
               )
```
