# Order Of Execution

In a select statement the order of execution goes something like this:

SELECT * FROM STUDENTS;

1. FROM (TABLE IS LOADED)
2. SELECT (COLUMNS ARE SELECTED BASED ON WHAT IS INTENDED TO BE SELECTED)
3. ORDER BY CLAUSE 

Now suppose we have something like 

```SQL
SELECT years_of_exp FROM students ORDER BY enrollment_date;
```
Execution order will be 
1. FROM 
2. SELECT [This will still select the enrollment date though it is not asked for explicitly]
3. ORDER BY

Another situation 
```SQL
SELCT DISITINCT years_of_exp FROM Students ORDER BY enrollment_date; 
```
This will throw an error since the system internally selects enrollment_date as well in the select statement and the DISTINCT query becomes
```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT years_of_exp, enrollment_date FROM students;
```
which will definitely show unwanted or unexpected results hence giving an error.
