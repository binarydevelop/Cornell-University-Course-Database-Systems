## Reading Data

### Implies to return all columns from the table. 
```SQL
mysql> SELECT * FROM cats;
+----+-------+-------------+------+
| id | name  | breed       | age  |
+----+-------+-------------+------+
|  1 | tobby | griffyindor |    2 |
+----+-------+-------------+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
---

- We can specify columns to be returned. 
```SQL
mysql> SELECT name, age, breed from cats;
+-------+------+-------------+
| name  | age  | breed       |
+-------+------+-------------+
| tobby |    2 | griffyindor |
+-------+------+-------------+
```
---

### WHERE Clause
- Where gives you freedom to access rows based on some condition.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM cats where name='tobby'
```
Generally this is not casesensitive. 
but we can make this casesensitive by using keyword `binary`
Example :

```SQL
SELECT * FROM cats WHERE binary name = 'tobby';
```


Also we can also compare columns of the same table. 
Example: 
```SQL
SELECT * FROM cats where age=id;
```

### Aliases
It describes how we want our data back.
```SQL
mysql> SELECT id AS cat_id, breed as Type_of_cat FROM cats;
+--------+-------------+
| cat_id | Type_of_cat |
+--------+-------------+
|      1 | griffyindor |
+--------+-------------+
```
