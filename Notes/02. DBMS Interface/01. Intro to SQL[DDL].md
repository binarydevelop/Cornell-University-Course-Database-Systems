## DBMS Interface
It is essentially the interface that we as user are directly or using the application is using.

## SQL Intro

The DBMS basically supports called SQL -> Structured Query Language. This is what we use essentially
to issue commands to the DBMS. 

### SQL Command Types 

- DDL : Data Definition Language
    - Define admissible database content (schema)
    - Structure of database type constraints 

- DML : Data Manipulation Language
    - change and retrieve database content

- TCL : Transaction Control Language
    - Groups SQL commands (transactions)

- DCL : Data Control Language
    - Assign data access rights

## Data Definition Language

### Defining Database Schema
It basically defines the content that we can insert in our database. 
we can define Each relation and its columns and their types. And when we insert 
data it needs to comply with the datatype defined. Apart from that we can also more constraints 
on single relations as well as constraints on multiple relations.  

```SQL
• CREATE TABLE <table> (<table-def>)
• <table> is the table name
• <table-def> is comma-separated column definitions
• Column definition is of form <col-name> <col-type>
```

Example: 
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Students(Sid int, Sname text, Gpa real);
CREAtE TABLE Enrollments(Sid int, Cid int);
CREATE TABLE Courses(Cid int, Cname int);
```
