## Integrity Constraints
• Constraints that limit admissible content of tables  
• DBMS enforces integrity constraints  
• Can be added to tables via "ALTER TABLE" command  
● Alternatively, can define when creating table  

There are different places where we can add these constraints in the schema like while creating the table or altring the table after creation of it. 

Types of constraints: 
1. Primary Key  
It says one column or a combination of column refers to an id a unique identifier.  
● A primary key constraint refers to a single table  
• It identifies a subset of columns as key columns  
Fixing values for key columns must identify row  
• No two rows have same values in key columns  
   ### Primary Key Syntax
   ```SQL
        • ALTER TABLE <table>
        ADD CONSTRAINT Primary Key (<key-cols>);
        • <table> is the table name
        ● <key-cols> is comma-separated list of column names
    ```

Example :
```SQL
    ALTER TABLE Students ADD PRIMARY KEY(Sid);
    ALTER TABLE Enrollment ADD PRIMARY KEY(sid,cid);
    ALTER TABLE Courses ADD PRIMARY KEY(cid);
```
While creating a new table : 
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Students (
    ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);
```
For Enrollments table we have (sid, cid) because a student can be enrolled in multiple courses and a single course can have multiple students. so instead of identifying
with one sid or cid we use combination of them to be unique. 
So it basically mean a course is not unique and a student is not unique in enrollment table but combination of these is unique. 

2. Foreign Key
This links two tables and in one of the tables is identified by a set of foreign key columns; 

Foreign Key Constraint
• A foreign key constraint links two tables
• Identifies set of foreign key columns in table 1
• Maps foreign key columns to primary key of table 2
• Values in foreign key column must appear as primary key
● Maps each row in table 1 to a row from table 2  

  ### Foreign Key Syntax
  ```SQL
• ALTER TABLE <table-1>
ADD CONSTRAINT Foreign Key (<fkey-columns>)
REFERENCES <table-2> (<pkey-columns>);
• <table-1> is table with foreign key columns
• <fkey-column> is comma-separated foreign key columns
• <table-2> is table with primary key columns
• <pkey-columns> is comma-separated primary keys
```
Example: 
```SQL
 ALTER TABLE enrollment ADD FOREIGN KEY(sid) REFERENCES Students(sid);
 ALTER TABLE enrollment ADD FOREIGN KEY(cid) REFERENCES Courses(cid);
```
so what happens is if we try to insert some data in enrollment table with sid or cid which is not yet in their respective
tables then it will throw an error.
