## DML Language

With DML we can insert, update, delete and analyze data. 

### Inserting Data
Syntax: 
```SQL
Inserting one (fully specified) row into a table:
• INSERT INTO <table> VALUES (<value-list>)
Inserting one (partially specified) row into a table:
• INSERT INTO <table> (<column-list>)
VALUES (<value-list>)
```
Inserting
```SQL
INSERT INTO students VALUES(0,'Tushar',9.0);

INSERT INTO Courses Values(0, 'CS001');
INSERT INTO Courses Values(1, 'CS002');

// INSERT 0 1 [0 IS REPLACED BY OBJECT ID WHEN POSTGRES ASSIGNS ONE WHEREAS 1 DENOTES THE NUMBER OF ROWS AFFECTED]
```

### Deleting Data
Syntax: 
```SQL
Deleting Data
Deleting rows from a table that satisfy condition
• DELETE FROM <table> WHERE <condition>
• <condition> specifies Boolean predicate
E.g., (in)equalities between columns
• Will discuss conditions in detail later
```
Example: 
```SQL
DELETE FROM enrollment WHERE sid = 0 ;
```

### Updating Data
```SQL
Updating specific rows and columns to new value:
• UPDATE <table>
SET <column> <value>
WHERE <condition>
Changes rows satisfying <condition>
by writing <value> in <column>
```
Example: 
```SQL
UPDATE students SET Sname = 'John Doe' WHERE sid=0;
```
